#init__.py is a special file in Python that is used to indicate that the directory it is present in is a package. 
# It can be an empty file or it can contain initialization code for the package. When you import a package, the code in __init__.py is executed, allowing you to set up any necessary variables, functions, or classes that should be available when the package is imported.
